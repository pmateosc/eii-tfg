 abstract = {1. Studies on a nest of the leaf-cutting ant Atta cephalotes in tropical rain forest in Guyana were continued for 58 days and showed that the ants were nocturnal. 2. The directional distribution of attacked plants about the nest was uneven, but the pattern was consistent throughout the study period. The distribution of foraging effort was similarly uneven, and the pattern varied. 3. The distance distribution from the nest of attacked plants revealed constant area exploitation up to 31.2 m, a zone of increased exploitation from 31.3 to 46.8 m and thereafter a falling off; this pattern was consistent throughout the study period. The distribution of foraging effort was broadly similar, but varied with time. 4. 62\% of all new foraging records were in the 0-3 m height range although the majority (37\%) of foraging activity was in the high canopy over 12.2 m. 5. 25\% of all plants attacked were cut on more than one occasion, one tree being exploited on nineteen consecutive nights. 6. The pattern of usage of the six main trails leading from the nest varied markedly with time. 7. Of the seventy-two species of woody plants identified in the nest area, thirty-six were attacked; this ratio did not differ significantly from 1/1 when comparable sampling effort was taken into account. Evidence of selectivity in the degree to which the ants exploited the species was apparent. 8. The ants did not cut the nearest specimen of the exploited species to the nest, there being on average at least 6.2 nearer intact specimens. 9. There was evidence of changes with time in the pattern of species attacked. 10. It is suggested that A. cephalotes has developed a conservational grazing system which prevents it from over-exploiting, and so destroying the vegetation in the area around the nest. It is further argued that the introduction of agriculture disrupts this pattern, and may contribute to the animal's pest status.},

Five individual saithe, Pollachius virens, were able to join schools of 25 normal saithe swimming in an annular tank, while blinded with opaque eye covers. Test fish maintained position within the school indefinitely and responded to short-term movements of individuals within the school, although quantitative differences in reaction time and schooling behavior were noted. Five fish with lateral lines cut at the opercula were unable to school when wearing opaque eye covers. Although it is unlikely that blind saithe could school in the wild, the constraints of the apparatus permitted a demonstration of a role of the lateral line organ in schooling.},

    abstract = "{Modelling and simulations of the migration of pelagic fish. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 826–838. We applied an interacting particle model to the Icelandic capelin stock to reproduce the spawning migration route for three different years, successfully predicting the route for 2008. Using available temperature data and approximated currents, and without using artificial forcing terms or a homing instinct, our model was able to reproduce the observed migration routes from all 3 years. By a sensitivity analysis, we identified oceanic temperature and the balance between the influence of interaction among particles and the particles' response to temperature as the control parameters most significant in determining the migration route. One significant contribution of this paper is the inclusion of orders of magnitude more particles than similar models, which affects the global behaviour of the model by propagating information about surrounding temperature through the school more efficiently. To maintain the same dynamics between different simulations, we argue a linear relationship between the time-step, radii of interactions, and the spatial resolution, and we argue that these scale as N−1/2, where N is the number of particles.}",
